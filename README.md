# openfarmer

Farming tools that exist today are proprietary, expensive, and not open source. This project will change that.

## Projects

1. Autonomouse pesticide/fertilizer sprayer

Can we make something that does 80% of what [Verdant Robotics](https://www.verdantrobotics.com/) does for 10 times cheaper?
